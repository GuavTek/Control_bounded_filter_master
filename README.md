<h3> Control-bounded filter </h3>
<p> This project tries to implement a filter for a control-bounded ADC. The 'models' sub-repository contains the python models used to verify that the architectures would work.
The 'HDL' sub-repository contains the verilog and systemC code used to synthesize the implementation. </p>
